# FiiSoft Basics
Few simple classes for my own purposes.

My advice is - do not use it unless you are enough strong mentally to immune for such bad code. 
But of course you can if you want.

#### `AbstractConfiguration`

Abstract class for other classes intended to hold simple configuration.

#### `Date`

Some procedural functions (methods in class Date) to help do some useful things with dates, such as converting and formatting them.

#### `SpecificationValidator`

Specialised class to validate some data provided as array in specific format.

See tests for some examples of use these classes.
